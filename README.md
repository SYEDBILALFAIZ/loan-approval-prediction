# 💰 Loan Approval Prediction  

This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant details.  
It uses the **Kaggle Loan Prediction dataset** and demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Project Workflow  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Handled **missing values**  
- Encoded **categorical features**  
- Balanced dataset using **SMOTE**  

### 2. Model Training  
- Trained **Logistic Regression**  
- Applied **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- Compared model performances  

### 3. Model Evaluation  
- Evaluated using **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**  
- Visualized confusion matrices
